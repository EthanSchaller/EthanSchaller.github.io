This calculator was made in my first year of school for a school project. The app acts as a calulator to find out how much money drivers of a company are owed in reimbursements based on how many KM's are traveled each day.

This app is a great example of how far I've come in my coding journey as it is a very bare bones app thaty has a very narrow use case compaired to my more recent projects.
