 This project gave me the task of making a classic arcade game with java. After we completed that we were then tasked with turning it into a working  server/client game. Some people chose to make games like <em>Galaga</em> or <em>Frogger</em> but <em>PacMan</em> was a clear choice in my mind. <em>PacMan</em> was always a game that I loved so I was really exited when this came up and I could make my own version.

 <em>PacMan</em> is a quite simple game concept but was a fun challenge to tackle. My version includes the normal four ghosts but this time with diferent movement patterns. These patterns include; Moving randomly with influence from PacMan's position (Red and Blue), Circling the perimeter of the map but moves faster than the rest (Pink), and Moving through walls straight towards PacMan (Orange). You as Pacman needs to collect all the pellets on screen while dodging the ghosts that are moving around. The game ends when either PacMan is hit by a ghost or all the pellets are collected.

 Learning game programming in java allowed me to strengthen my skills with java and adding things like threading and servers into my repertoire. Java is a very fun language to learn and code with as it allows you to make almost anything that you want. Although this isn't my best work that i've ever done, I think it is a great showing of my earlier work and how far i've come as well as show how fast I could learn these techniques in only a few months of starting Java game programming.
